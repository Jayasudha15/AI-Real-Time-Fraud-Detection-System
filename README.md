# 🚨 AI-Powered Real-Time Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a semi real-time fraud detection system built using:

- Flask (Backend API)
- SQLite (Database)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Pandas & Matplotlib (Analytics)
- Adaptive Anomaly Detection

The system simulates live transactions, predicts fraud probability,
monitors model performance, and provides an interactive dashboard.
